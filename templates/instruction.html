      There are four elements that are part of the Digital Expedition of

      Within each of the 4 elements of the AMPS StratahedronTM are three
      sub-elements that define the parameters of each of your main elements.
      These sub-elements further identify the course of actions that can be
      taken to further align and identify your AMPS structure
    </div>
    <div class="flex w100 flex-start font-normal p-small">
      When these four elements are defined and physically connected together,
      they are able to form a unique, 3-Dimensional 4-sided pyramid shape, that
      is unique to you and only your business. This shape is called a
      Tetrahedron, and it contains your Strategic DNA - the core of what you do
      and how you deliver your value. When it is combined with your strategic
      elements, it becomes a StratahedronTM- your 3-Dimensional structure of
      your strategy. While the 4 sided shape is similar to all businesses and a
      foundation for all, only you have the defined structure within the
      StratahedronTM as you are able to create it specifically for you and your
      business.

      Within the larger structure of the 4 triangles, are the internal
      structures that this model creates, expands and demonstrates, once in the
      3-D shape, they become the core vertices of:

      Finally, the Content #Hashtags are content topics that are an integral
      part of your strategy model. These are concepts that are connecting the
      pieces of the model together through the main vertices - topics that you
      can carry forward and that can pull your audience and community together.

      The StratahedronTM is a design strategy tool to help you see and visualize

      intersections are, and how to get clarity with your business in a
      multitude of directions.

      It takes the four major elements of Audience, Method, Process & Story, and

      Transformation & journey of digital transformation.

      After entering the details of your AMPS StratahedronTM - you can then
      print it out and create your own, individual StratahedronTM that can then
      be assembled into the Tetrahedron shape. You can also email the model to
      yourself, to print and assemble more StratahedronsTM

        Once printed, cut out the outer edge of the flat shape of the
        4-triangles or tetrahedron from your piece of paper, leaving the tabs,
        along with the triangles
      </div>

        </span>
        Fold all of the edges, tabs and triangles inwards. It will start to form
        a tetrahedron. Fold the tabs and stick each of the 3 tabs under each of
        the corresponding edges of each triangle. If you have glue - add glue to
        the top of each tab before placing under. If you have tape, tape over
        the edges to hold each side together.

      <div class="flex w100 flex-start font-normal p-small">
        <span class="font-weight-bold" style="width: 6%">Step 5: Enjoy! </span>
        Take a look at your StratahedronTM and see how it all comes together in
        multiple dimensions. Rotate it around and see how it further connects
        and refines what you business is about, and how you deliver your value.

      <span class="font-weight-bold" style="width: 3%">TIP :</span>Answer the
      questions with the first ideas that come to mind. Then, if you find they
      donâ€™t fit properly, in the context of all of them together, change them to
      reflect your new converging ideas. Nothing is set in stone and the
      StratahedronTM is meant to be a dynamic process, so change it until youâ€™re
      comfortable that it fits for you.
